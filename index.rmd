## Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Oxford

I am an ecologist interested in population dynamics and life history evolution. My work covers a variety of topics including population regulation and resilience, the role of reproductive traits and early life history events, and comparative demography.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Oxford in the Biology Department. I am a member of the [SalGo Team](https://salgo.web.ox.ac.uk/welcome), and also a College Lecturer in Biology at [Balliol College](https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/dr-christina-hernandez). My position is funded by a NERC "Pushing the Frontiers" grant led by Rob Salguero-Gómez with co-investigators [Iain Stott](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/11dc70c0-5aa2-4cf1-af55-88ef8f87e189) (Univ. of Lincoln) and [Andy Hector](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-andrew-hector) (Oxford). This project will build on [previous work on population resilience](https://salgo.web.ox.ac.uk/article/creating-comparative-framework-demographic-resilience), expanding our mathematical and theoretical tools for studying resilience to apply to more realistic populations, disturbance regimes, and across hierarchical levels: from individuals, to populations, to communities.

In my doctoral thesis work, I focused on the distribution, growth, and transport of larval fishes. My thesis included chapters about [tropical tuna spawning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47161-0) in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (central tropical Pacific), [Atlantic bluefin tuna spawning](https://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/the-secret-tuna-nursery/) in the [Slope Sea](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0444), and a trait-based approach to studying [coral reef fish dispersal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-023-02355-x). I also worked on the evolutionary demography of [maternal effect senescence](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/28/16431), a particular class of maternal effects that we studied using data from a novel model organism.

From late 2020-2023, I was a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. In that position, I developed an [exact version of Life Table Response Experiments](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14065) and an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exactLTRE/index.html) to go along with it ([Video webinar on the package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEjqJHotUTM&list=PL4ADF7CAA34DD8E4D&index=72&ab_channel=MethodsEcolEvol)). I also studied the role of 'luck' in life histories across the wide variety of plant and animal population models available through the [COM(P)ADRE databases](compadre-db.org). This position was in collaboration with and supervised by [Steve Ellner](http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/Ellner/) (Cornell), [Giles Hooker](http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~hooker/) (Cornell), [Robin Snyder](https://case.edu/artsci/biol/snyder/snyder.html) (Case Western Reserve), and [Peter Adler](https://qcnr.usu.edu/labs/adler_lab/index) (Utah State).
