## Postdoctoral Associate, Cornell University

I am currently a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I am working on a theoretical ecology project, supervised by [Steve Ellner] (http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/Ellner/) (Cornell), [Giles Hooker] (http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~hooker/) (Cornell), Robin Snyder (Case Western Reserve), and Peter Adler (Utah State).
